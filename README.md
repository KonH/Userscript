# LDJam-Local-Favorite-List-Userscript
Add games into a list, so I can play it later

You need sÂ some browser extension like [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)(Chrome) to install userscript.

It stored a list into your local Storage.

Ah... I know it works like your browser's bookmark or favorite folder or something.

But it looks good when it shows up on the website...
